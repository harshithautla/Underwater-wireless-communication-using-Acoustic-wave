# Underwater-wireless-communication-using-Acoustic-wave
In the underwater world, the application of wireless 
communications is of great interest to the military, industry, 
and the scientific community. 
• Acoustic systems have enjoyed great success under water 
owing to their ability to communicate over many kilometres
Nevertheless, its performance is linked to the physical nature 
that limits the bandwidth, causes high latency, produces high 
transmission losses, time varying multi-path propagation and 
Doppler’s spread. 
• These limitations do not allow autonomous underwater 
vehicles (AUV) to transmit real-time video in high definition via 
acoustic communication. 
• Additionally, standard acoustic underwater communication, 
due to its bad performance features such as high bit error 
rates, large and variable propagation delays and low 
bandwidth, are particularly vulnerable to malicious attacks 

Our objective is to Obtain Accurate Communication Using Acoustic wave
• Acoustic is the most preferred signal used as carrier by many
application, following to its low absorption characteristic for 
underwater communication.
• By reducing noises and losses as more as possible, this helps us 
to obtain an accurate communication
